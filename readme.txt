Server developed with node.js

Provides RESTful API for the Android client to use for the app named "Mission Pangpang."

The app is intended to teach young kids discipline to do things that they usually would not want to do by providing rewards if they complete the set task.

1. Parents set the mission and reward. They can set the time period, and the number of repetitions for a certain task.
2. Child sends a confirmation request everytime they performs the designated task.
3. Parents check if the child has really done the task, and if so, confirms the request.
4. If the child performs the full amount of the mission, reward is given to the child.
